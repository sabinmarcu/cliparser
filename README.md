# CLI Parser

Have you ever heard of a language named [Typescript]("http://typescriptlang.com/")?
It's a cool new programming language created by [ Microsoft ]("http://microsoft.com/") that extends Javascript and adds cool new functionality like classes, with private, public scopes, constructors, ... it basically makes Javascript a lot less chaotic.

This particular project has the point of helping me do some cool stuff with Typescript (or learn to do it :P)

## I hope that one day it might help people to do some stuff with it, apart from helping me understand it.
